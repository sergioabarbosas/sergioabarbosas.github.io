I am deeply passionate about intelligent systems, with a research focus on the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and human understanding. My goal is to develop conversational agents that interact with people in a human-like manner.

Throughout my professional and academic career, I have concentrated on DL, ML, NLP. Leveraging my background in computer science, I have advanced the development of conversational systems by utilizing the capabilities of AI and specialized language models.

Recently, my work has included:

1. Developing thesis on the design and implementation of a modular software architecture for RAG systems in LLM‚Äëbased virtual assistants with focus on exploring conversational memory factors üß†. 

2. Innovating technological solutions based on language models to create conversational agents for digital transformation, applied in sectors such as healthcare ‚öïÔ∏è and business.

My highly motivated doctoral research is driven by a strong interest in the convergence of AI and human understanding. This field has fueled my intellectual curiosity, as I am fascinated by how language serves not only as a communicative tool but also as a computational instrument. The inherent human ability to understand and generate novel statements from limited data underscores language's role in acquiring new concepts and shaping our reasoning processes.
