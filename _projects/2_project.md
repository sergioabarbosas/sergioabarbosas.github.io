The main contribution of this work is the fine‑tuning of a model using a proprietary dataset extracted from social networks, georeferenced in Colombia, and manually labelled with typical and dialect‑specific features. Indeed, the experiment compares the performance of TLM models adjusted to the Colombian slang domain against a GPT, having a significant impact on achieving more accurate predictions in this task.
