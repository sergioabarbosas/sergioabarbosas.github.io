The main contribution of this work is the fine‑tuning of a model using a proprietary dataset extracted from social networks, georeferenced in Colombia, and manually labelled with typical and dialect‑specific features. Indeed, the experiment compares the performance of TLM models adjusted to the Colombian slang domain against a GPT, having a significant impact on achieving more accurate predictions in this task.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
