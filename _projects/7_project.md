Developed a computer vision system to label and analyze students' emotions using advanced image processing techniques. This meritorious thesis in computer vision was achieved by implementing an AI model that utilizes Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to assess students’ emotions during virtual classes based on their facial expressions, gaze, and gestures.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
