In the context of the growing trend of virtual education models, it is important to consider the significance of emotional feedback and real-time interaction between teachers and students. This approach aims to understand students' emotional states and to develop learning strategies that enhance attention levels.

The literature includes various techniques for systematic detection of affective states, many of which are costly in terms of computational and economic resources. In a virtual learning environment, this work proposes an emotion classification model to label and analyze students' emotions using advanced image processing techniques.

This meritorious thesis in computer vision was achieved by implementing an AI model that utilizes Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to assess students’ emotions during virtual classes based on their facial expressions, gaze, and gestures.
